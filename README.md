Project 1

Exercise 1. The Geometric Distribution.

a) Make a program in any language which calculates probability (with geometric distribution)
of having success exactly at k-th trial with probability of success p.

b) Find the probability if k = 11 and p = 0.447.

c) Find the probability that k is at most 13 for p= 0.3

d) Find the probability that k is between 16 and 19, inclusive, for p = 0.15.

Exercise 2. The Negative Binomial Distribution.

a) Make a program in any language which calculates probability (with negative binomial
distribution) of having r successes exactly at k-th trial with probability of success p.

b) Find the probability if k = 11, r = 5 and p = 0.35.

c) Find the probability that k is between 16 and 19, inclusive for r = 3, p = 0.65.

d) Sketch the probability mass function for r = 4, p = 0.6 and k = 5; 6; 7; ...; 15.
